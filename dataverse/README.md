# Integration with Dataverse



This doc presents the output of the hack project aiming to integrate the Dataverse with the Dataspaces. 
The Dataverse was used as a data source orchestrated with a feature to publish assets and contract definitions to the EDC.
This project is based on the instructions from the [Dataverse & EDC doc](link).
